        <h2>Why IT?</h2><br><hr>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Before anything else, I would like to introduce myself. Hello, I am Moises Danielle Tulinao,
             currently going at the University of Cebu as a BSIT student.<br> </p>
        <h2>IT THAN BSME</h2>
        <p>Going back now, why did you choose IT?, Well, to be honest, at first, I didn't plan on becoming 
           an IT student, I choose the STEM strand in hoping to become a bonified Marine Engineering oneday, 
           I was greatly inspired by my Father who is one, travelling the seven seas. I really thought that
           I was going to become like that, but after I graduated SHS I was faced by my fathe's and mother's 
           disapproval on becoming someone who will one day sail the seas. After many arguments and fights,
           not only did I lose the war, but I feel like i've lost my long dream. But instead of going to 
           despair, I picked myself up and googled the most demanding job and the most high-paying job in
           the Philippines. And there I saw it, "IT makes around 15-50k as an intern". Without second thought,
           I chose IT, not because I was inspired, not because it was my dream, but because I know that I will be
           rich while working home. That's all for my reason on why I chose IT as my course, but one thing for 
           certain, I will come to love this course, even if it's hard and tiring, as long as I have the 
           determination and set goals, I know that  I will succedd in this industry someday. </p>

        <h1><head>My Biography</head></h1>
        <h2>Why IT?</h2><br><hr>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Before anything else, I would like to introduce myself. Hello, I am Moises Danielle Tulinao,
             currently going at the University of Cebu as a BSIT student.<br> </p>
        <h2>HOBBIES AND GOALS</h2>
        <p>As an ambivert, my hobbies as of now consist of playing online games, watching anime and reading
             different kinds of manhua, manga, and other types of series. Besides that, I do calisthenics, 
             occasionally play badminton and run. My goals for my future is to be a succesful programmer and
             become rich. To travel the world, help my family in the future, especially my parents, and marry
             the girl I love in the future. Overall, I don't wanna go hungry in the future, have fun and live
             life to the fullest without ever holding back. Well, as long as it doesn't harm me, my family and 
             loved ones. </p>
        <h2>IT THAN BSME</h2>
        <p>Going back now, why did you choose IT?, Well, to be honest, at first, I didn't plan on becoming 
           an IT student, I choose the STEM strand in hoping to become a bonified Marine Engineering oneday, 
           I was greatly inspired by my Father who is one, travelling the seven seas. I really thought that
           I was going to become like that, but after I graduated SHS I was faced by my fathe's and mother's 
           disapproval on becoming someone who will one day sail the seas. After many arguments and fights,
           not only did I lose the war, but I feel like i've lost my long dream. But instead of going to 
           despair, I picked myself up and googled the most demanding job and the most high-paying job in
           the Philippines. And there I saw it, "IT makes around 15-50k as an intern". Without second thought,
           I chose IT, not because I was inspired, not because it was my dream, but because I know that I will be
           rich while working home. That's all for my reason on why I chose IT as my course, but one thing for 
           certain, I will come to love this course, even if it's hard and tiring, as long as I have the 
           determination and set goals, I know that  I will succedd in this industry someday. </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>I just want to be a guy, a person, a human who will one day wake up in bed thinking of nothing
            but what to do next without a worry in the world. Well, except for work of course. To study more
            and gain more knowledge about this field and to be a decent human being. And lastly, to not have 
            any regrets going forward.
